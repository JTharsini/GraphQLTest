IDE: VSCode

1. initializing new node js project: (creates a package.json)
npm init
2. install apollo-server along with graphql support:
npm install apollo-server graphql
3. install nodemon to have hot deployment:
npm install nodemon
4. npm start should execute index.js covered by nodemon:
add "start": "nodemon index.js" in package.json
5. add index.js
6. npm start : to start app
7. Apollo GraphQL extension for IDE: highlighting graphql

project structure:
-add schema folder: to keep type

- http://localhost:4000/ in browser: can see server once npm start without crashes
- apollo-server has built-in api tester ("Query your server" button)
-in explorer gives the result:

query GetAllUsers {
  users {
    name
    username
  }
}

-If one of the FakeData's mandatory field is null and requesting for that data ==> the query fails
